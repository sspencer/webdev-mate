For web developers using TextMate, webdev-mate contains scripts that make
it easier to develop multiple sites on multiple machines.

1. open_in_browser - for local development with multiple different
   virtual hosts, pressing ⌘-U opens the current file in the correct
   virtual domain.

2. rsync_file - if you're like me and have given up Emacs for TextMate,
   and some of your web site development requires Linux, use this to
   edit files locally on the Mac have has ⌘-S (Save) sync them to Linux.
