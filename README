For web developers using TextMate, webdev-mate contains scripts that make
it easier to develop multiple sites on multiple machines.

Note, these scripts are save in this repository as ruby files.  To add
them to your TextMate Bundle, create a new bundle in the Bundle Editor
and copy/paste them.

1. open_in_browser - for local development with multiple different
   virtual hosts, pressing ⌘-U opens the current file in the correct
   virtual domain.

2. rsync_file - if you're like me and have given up Emacs for TextMate,
   and some of your web site development requires Linux, use this to
   edit files locally on the Mac have has ⌘-S (Save) sync them to Linux.

3. rsync-project - similar to rsync_file, but syncs the entire project.
   Uses the same RSYNC_LOCAL / RSYNC_REMOTE project variables.
